This directory contains a build system to build custom RRR cmodules. 

Dependencies:
- Installed RRR library present in system library directories
- Installed RRR binary present in PATH
- Installed RRR headers (/usr/include/rrr files)
- Installed autotools and compiler

Notes:
The RRR signature of RRR library functions and sizes of data structures
may change between versions. All custom cmodules should be updated as
needed and re-built when the library is upgraded.

Preparations:
- Copy this whole directory to somewhere else outside the RRR source tree
- Follow instructions in the file HOWTO to create a custom module

Build:
- Run ./autogen.sh
- Run make
- Run make install
