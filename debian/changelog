rrr (1.29-2) bookworm; urgency=medium

  * Changes:
    * In route definition, the I operator is replaced with D. Existing programs
      must be updated to prevent warning from being printed.
    * Changed signatures for processor functions by adding a new last argument
      'method'. Existing scripts MAY BREAK and should be updated. Refer to
      the rrr.conf.5 manual page for correct function signatures.
    * Set process and thread names on OS-es where this is possible. This can
      assist when debugging for instance CPU usage.

  * Features:
    * Match generated messages in httpclient with their corresponding message
      triggering the query by using a report tag
    * Route messages leaving an instance to specific reader instances by topic
      or array tags

      serialize the JSON added to messages this way.
    * New parameter methods for cmodules (python3, js, perl5, lua and cmodule)
      allowing messages content to be identified before being processed. The
      processor function receives a method name.

  * Improvements:
    * Timeout changes in httpclient and rotate deferred to msgdb PUT
      messages to ensure all are attempted and not the same messages time out
      repeatedly.
    * In JS, refuse bare name module imports (require prefix like ./) and
      process relative paths correctly with respect to directory of importing
      script.
    * In httpclient, print stats about dropped messages in periodic function
      instead of once for every message.
    * Add warning when buffer entry count exceeds a certain configurable limit

      invalid characters.

  * Fixes:
    * Raw data messages in JS module now working properly
    * Crash in JS module upon GC due to null pointer access
    * Httpclient sometimes spinning on CPU indefinitely after handshaking if
      there is no data to send on a socket.
    * Readers were blocked in message broker when writer used do_again during
      slot write (fast writes from dummy module with buffer=no).
    * Deadlock in rrr_stats due to printing messages during signal handling
    * Soft error was ignored in socket client collection also when socket
      surely was closed, like when 0 bytes were read. This caused the socket
      not to be closed with following CPU spin due do constant POLLIN event.
      The soft error is now forced to propagate if bytes read is zero so that
      only data errors are ignored (which is also intention of higher levels).
    * Connections were closed in IP module when byte by byte sync was used
      and the alignment used up all remaining buffered bytes.
    * Non-working default socket name in msgdb module causing crash
    * Incorrect tick timer in msgdb causing excessive CPU usage
    * Memory leak of HV in Perl subroutine call helper function

    * Use events in file module
    * Common send loop for file and ip modules
