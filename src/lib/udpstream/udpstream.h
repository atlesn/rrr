// This API is used to provide regulated safe delivery of messages using
// UDP. This is useful for lossy connections and where TCP timers or head of line
// blocking cause issues.

// NOT SAFE ON OPEN NETWORKS, IMPLEMENT AT OWN RISK

// A client may be configured to accept connections from other clients. Two
// clients will together create a stream which they use to transfer data.
// Received data must be acknowledged to the sender.

// A large message might be split up into smaller frames, this is handled
// automatically and the API user only sends in whole messages of arbitrary
// size and the receiver will get them out exactly as sent.

// There is also support for "assured single delivery"/"ASD" of messages. But this
// requires the API user to hold sent and received messages. This API
// however, provides message types to handle this the way MQTT QoS2 works
// and will send the appropriate ACK messages back an forward even if a
// client does not actually implement ASD. If a client chooses not to, it must
// provide a dummy callback function to the API.

// UDP-stream is thread-safe but is not optimized for threading in any particular
// way as all API functions use the same lock. Many UDP-stream entries may however
// be created and accessed at the same time as no static data is used anywhere (apart
// from in the RRR socket API, but it has its own locking anyway).

// Each UDP-stream instance has its own lock. Note that callbacks provided by API user to certain
// functions needs to implement some form of locking if different UDP-streams are used by
// multiple threads. If only one UDP-stream is used by multiple threads, no such locking is
// needed as the callbacks will be protected by the UDP-stream lock.

// Please note that no UDP-stream functions may be called from the callbacks, this will always
// cause a deadlock.

// Data sent to UDP-stream is copied, indicated by using const pointers. For data given to
// back to the API user using the data callback function upon receival, it is expected that
// the callback takes care of this memory or frees it, also on errors. If not, it will always
// leak. This is indicated with the pointer being non-const.
