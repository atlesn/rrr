// ---- Read Flags - Avoid collision with rrr_socket_constants.h

#define RRR_READ_MESSAGE_FLUSH_OVERSHOOT     (1<<15)

// ---- Standardized return values 

// These return values are standardized throughout RRR. Anyone who
// distinguishes between HARD and SOFT errors should use these values,
// possibly wrapped in private more appropriate names for the particular
// application.

// The standardized values allow return values from different frameworks
// in some circumstances to propagate without being translated. A common
// method is to trap the SOFT error only and do some special tasks like
// deferring a message for later retry or closing a connection, and let
// all other values be interpreted as HARD error and quitting all operations.

// These values may be used both with checking directly using == or as
// bit flags. It is not recommended to use bitwise return values for library
// frameworks used by many other frameworks and modules, this becomes messy.

// For special cases, consider giving feedback to the caller by using integer
// pointers in the function arguments like (int *a_happened, int *b_happened),
// or by having status information stored in callback data structures.

// Please ignore the fact that the names contain "READ", they are used for
// writing and all sorts of other tasks.

// Return values are ALWAYS of type "int"

// In functions where the type of error is always the same (failed input
// validation is usually always a soft error, init function fails are
// always hard errors), the function should return 0 for ok or 1
// for error, WITHOUT using ANY macros.

// The comments for each value here are examples only.
